# ReactBootstrap01


This is the code to make a simple single page website which does not load.
when we click a link a specific componenet is rendered.

We perform 
- node install bootstrap --save
Go to App.js and import Boostrap by,
- import "../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/CSS/bootstrap.com";

To install react router dom do,
- npm install react-router-dom --save

Go to App.js and import these things

- import {BrowserRouter, Route, Routes} from "react-router-dom";



Also, it is recommended to use React-Bootstrap instead of simple bootstrap because the former is custom made keeping react in mind.
